Thank you for looking over my program!

This is the first significant program I have created on my own that has not been some example or exercise, so I'm pretty
proud of it! It is a simple program that automates a boring office task that I often have to do at work. It downloads
and works with .csv files to create reports based on the downloaded data.

It is important to note that:

    1) This program is still under development. There are still several features I'd like to add and tweaks I'd like to make.
    I expect it to be refactored several more times before the final iteration.

    2) As such, the structure of the file system is not optimized. There are files that might not need to be there, or
    which may be in a less-than-ideal location. This will all be addressed, at some point.

    3) The main file of this program is named "main.py"

    4) web_app.py is the start of the UI that I'm trying to build for this program. It is nowhere near completion, so
    please don't judge me lol. In fact, you can just ignore it for now.
