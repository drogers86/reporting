This iteration saw a few improvements and additions:

 - Added ability to navigate to multiple webpages
 - Modified login() to build and return a dictionary with key:value pairs as course id and course title instead of list
    - This made it work more efficiently within the main body
 - Deleted a ton of test code and commentary throughout
 - Rearranged and cleaned things up a bit

There are still things that I'm working on, and things I want to add:
 - immediate goal is to debug and get it working again
 - Next goal: web interface!
